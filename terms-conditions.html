    <div class="about-quote">
      <div class="paragraph-bigger cc-bigger-light">While I work as quickly as I can, the unpredictable nature of my work, repairing various, often obsolete electronic devices which contain discontinued components, occasionally tends towards fluctuation in price and time frame, an accurate estimate requires me to first identify the problem before I can provide a solution.<br><br>If the repair is very quick I&#x27;ll do it immediately, with a minimum charge of 1 hour.<br><br>If the repair will take longer, I will use the first hour to provide you with a price estimate for labour and spare parts.<br><br>I wish to provide my clients with my best work, and therefore, ask for the time and patience often required for sophisticated electronic repairs.<br>I will update you periodically as I progress in the repair and wait for your approval to proceed or not with the repair in case spare parts are very expensive or if the bill makes the repair not worthwhile.<br><br>I don&#x27;t repair kits/self-assembled gear so please mention it to me when asking for a repair.<br><br>If you&#x27;re sending gear to me via courier, please note that you are responsible for organising both drop-off and collection once the repair is complete.<br><br>I carry out most of my work in my workspace (Strongroom Studios) but will relocate as needed for jobs for which travel is necessary.<br>In these cases, a fee will be added on top of my usual rate to cover travel time and travel costs.<br>All the previous apply with the difference that the minimum charge is 3h.<br>‍<br></div>
      <h1 class="heading-2 paragraph-bigger">For all my repairs my rate is £50/hour + VAT<br>Payment by bank transfer</h1>
      <div class="divider"></div>
      <h1 class="heading-2 paragraph-bigger">Capsule Cleaning</h1>
      <div class="paragraph-bigger cc-bigger-light">I offer capsule cleaning services, typically priced between £100 and £150, depending on the type of microphone, the capsule’s condition, and the work required.<br>Please note that capsule cleaning is delicate and can only be performed a limited number of times before a reskin may be necessary.<br>I only recommend it when the capsule’s condition is clearly and significantly affecting the sound.<br>Due to the age and fragility of certain capsules, I cannot take responsibility if the diaphragm fails or if the membrane detaches during or after the service.<br>I will, however, do my best to help restore your capsule where possible.<br>‍</div>
      <h1 class="heading-2 paragraph-bigger">Work on Unfamiliar Equipment</h1>
      <div class="paragraph-bigger cc-bigger-light">As a general policy, I do not charge clients for the additional time I may spend learning a piece of equipment that is new to me.<br>I only bill for the hours that the work would reasonably take if I were already experienced with that model. However, please note that my ability to take on unfamiliar equipment depends on my workload and the value of the project.<br>In particularly busy periods, I may need to decline work on items that are uncommon, of lower value, or unlikely to be encountered again.<br>I will always aim to communicate clearly about the estimated time required and whether I can realistically take on the work.<br>My goal is to support clients while helping ensure that as much equipment as possible is kept in use rather than discarded.<br>‍</div>
      <h1 class="heading-2 paragraph-bigger">Repairs on Vintage and Consumer Equipment</h1>
      <div class="paragraph-bigger cc-bigger-light">When working on very old equipment (typically 60–70 years or older) or on certain types of consumer gear, additional risks are involved due to the fragility of materials and construction methods.<br>Plastic parts may break, connectors may fail, or assemblies may not be designed to be disassembled and reassembled.<br>In some cases, unrelated faults may appear during service — for example, a power supply failing while I am addressing a noise issue.<br>While I will always do my best to assist in these situations, please note that I cannot absorb all additional repair time at no cost.<br>Some equipment, particularly consumer models, can take significantly more time to service than professional gear designed for maintenance.<br>As a result, repair costs may occasionally exceed the original value of the item. I will always communicate openly about these risks and discuss whether it is practical to proceed.<br>‍</div>
      <h1 class="heading-2 paragraph-bigger">Updates to Terms and Conditions<br></h1>
      <div class="paragraph-bigger cc-bigger-light">I periodically update these Terms and Conditions to ensure they reflect the service I aim to provide as accurately as possible. Please note that prices may be subject to change over time.<br>‍</div>
